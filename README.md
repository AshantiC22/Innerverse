# Innerverse 🌌
**Bridging the gap between the real world and the virtual self.**

Innerverse is a state-driven mental health application designed to solve the "Clinical Abyss" found in modern wellness apps. By utilizing Python-driven logic and sentiment analysis, Innerverse transforms a user's real-world emotional state into a dynamic virtual world—much like a Sims environment—where personal growth is reflected visually and interactively.

## 🚀 The Vision
Most mental health apps fail due to lack of engagement, privacy breaches, and emotional dependency. **Innerverse** aims to be different by:
- **Gamifying Reflection:** Your mood isn't a chart; it's the weather, the growth of your garden, and the state of your avatar.
- **Privacy by Design:** Implementing local-first encryption to ensure user data is never monetized.
- **Safety Integration:** Using pattern recognition to trigger crisis support and professional care bridges when needed.

## 🛠 The Technical Roadmap

### Phase 1: The Logic Engine (Python Foundations)
- [ ] Build a terminal-based journal system.
- [ ] Integrate Natural Language Processing (NLP) to score sentiment (-1.0 to 1.0).
- [ ] Create a "World State" dictionary that maps scores to environment variables (e.g., `0.8 = Sunny`, `-0.5 = Rain`).

### Phase 2: Pattern Recognition & Safety
- [ ] Develop a "Mood History" tracker to identify 7-day trends.
- [ ] Implement "Red Flag" word detection for immediate crisis resource delivery.
- [ ] Build a "Check-in" system that notices changes in user behavior.

### Phase 3: The Vault (Security)
- [ ] Implement AES-256 encryption for all local journal entries.
- [ ] Create a secure login system that does not store sensitive data on external servers.

### Phase 4: The Interface (The Virtual World)
- [ ] Connect the Python backend to a frontend framework (React or Streamlit).
- [ ] Design dynamic visual assets that change based on the Logic Engine.
- [ ] Implement the "Sims" mechanic: An avatar that evolves as the user practices healthy habits.

## 📈 Why This Project?
This project is built to address the surge in mental health challenges affecting 23% of the U.S. population. It rejects the "profit-driven" model of modern apps in favor of evidence-based, professional care support and user-centric privacy.
